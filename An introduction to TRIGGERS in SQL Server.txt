An introduction to TRIGGERS in SQL Server

There are four main types of triggers these being DML triggers, DDL triggers, CLR(common runtime language) triggers and Logon triggers.
Data Definition Language (DDL) triggers fire in response to DDL events such as CREATE, ALTER and DROP (Table,View,Index,stored procedures.

Server Scoped DDL Triggers
----Database scoped trigger will be located in the 'Database Triggers' folder under 'Programmability' of the database
CREATE TRIGGERE tr_DatabaseScopeTrigger
ON DATABASE
FOR CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE, DROP_TABLE
AS
BEGIN
   ROLLBACK
   Print 'You can not create, alter or drop a table in the current database'
END


----Server scoped trigger must be at level ALL SERVER. This trigger will be found under the server in the 'Triggers' folder
CREATE TRIGGER tr_ServerScopeTrigger
ON ALL SERVER
FOR CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE, DROP_TABLE
AS
BEGIN
   ROLLBACK
   Print 'You can not create, alter or drop a table in any database on the server'
END

To disable the Server Scope trigger use the following:
DISABLE TRIGGER tr_ServerScopeTrigger ON ALL SERVER
To enable
ENABLE TRIGGER tr_ServerScopeTrigger ON ALL SERVER
