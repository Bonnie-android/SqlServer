WINDOW FUNCTIONS, GROUPING SETS, CUBES, ROLLUPS


GROUPING SETS



---- a group by statement
select
department,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
group by department, joblevel;

-------without group by sets we would do the following
select
department,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
group by department, joblevel
UNION ALL  --- stacking two tables
select
department,
null,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
group by department
UNION ALL
select
null,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
group by joblevel
UNION ALL
select
null,
null,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees

IN order to produce the above results the employees table will be read four times which will impact performance.
It is possible to obtain the same results from one table read which will greatly improve performance.
These functions are built into SQL Server and are called GROUPING SETS, CUBES and ROLLUPS.

Using GROUPING SETS we would write the statement as:
select
department,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
Group BY
GROUPING SETS
(
   (department, joblevel), ----sum of salary by department and job level
   (department),  ----- sum of salary by department
   (joblevel), ----- sum of salary by job level
   () -----sum of salary over all
)
ORDER BY Grouping(department),Grouping(joblevel),joblevel


ROLLUP Function
ROLLUP is used to do aggregarion operations on multiple levels in a hierarchy. 
Rollup also provides a grand total.

select
department,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department) ----will provide a sum of salary by department and a grand total



select
department,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
GROUP BY department WITH ROLLUP --- same results as above

select
department,
joblevel,
sum(salary) as total_salary
from
employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department,joblevel) ---will provide summary of salary by department and job level, by department and a grand total.
Note that we will not get sum of salary by job level only, for this we need to use the CUBE function.

CUBE
The Cube() function generates all possible combinations of columns specified in the GROUP BY CUBE() clause.
